administrative district, it is the largest housing estate in the Czech Republic.\n Large parts of Chodov and Háje, the two districts which belong to Prague 11, are part of Jižní Město.\n The natural areas Kunratický Les and Hostivař Park Forest border the estate, on the west and east sides respectively.\n The D1 highway connecting Prague to Brno runs through the

away in 1958 and 1959, the estate comprises 640 flats in five linear blocks of 10 to 14 storeys.\n It is the only public housing estate in Central and Western District developed by the Hong Kong Housing Authority and it is the second oldest existing public housing estate built by the Hong Kong Housing Authority, after Model Housing Estate.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 3\n\nCorrib Park is a housing estate in the Westside suburb of Galway, Ireland.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 4\n\nPrivate housing estate is a term used in Hong Kong for private mass housing – a housing estate developed by a private developer, as opposed to a public housing estate built by the Hong Kong Housing Authority or the Hong Kong Housing Society.\n It usually is characterised with a cluster of high-rise buildings, with its own market or shopping mall.\n Mei Foo Sun Chuen, built by Mobil, is the earliest (1965) and largest by number of blocks (99).\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 5\n\nMerley is a large housing estate in the borough of Poole, a mile (2 km) south of Wimborne Minster.\n Originally called Myrle, Merley was a manor in the tithing of Great Canford (or Canford Magna).\n The village merges with that of Oakley, and the housing estate was originally going to be called \"Oakley Garden Village\", note Oakley Shops and other signposts around the community but the name was changed.\n The housing estate only covers part of the area that was originally called Merley/Myrle.\n The Poole ward is Merley and Bearwood.\n The population of this ward taken at the 2011 census was 10,392.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 6\n\nSouthcourt is a housing estate in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England.\n Building commenced in the early 1920s through to the mid-1930s and only stopped because of the Second World War.\n It was turned into a post war housing estate during the years of 1946 and

the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham in East London, England.\n It is located 11 mi east-northeast of Charing Cross and was constructed in the interwar period as the largest public housing estate in the world.\n The Housing Act 1919 permitted the London County Council to build housing outside the County of London and Becontree was constructed between 1921 and 1935 to cottage estate principles in the parishes of Barking, Dagenham and Ilford in Essex.\n The official completion of the estate was celebrated in 1935 with a population of around 100,000 people in 26,000 homes.\n The building of the estate caused a huge increase in population density which led to demands on services and reforms of local government.\n An additional 1,000 houses were added in later phases.\n The estate initially had no industrial and very little commercial development until the May & Baker and Ford Dagenham sites opened nearby, and a shopping area was built at Heathway.\n The estate has formed part of Greater London since 1965, when the Barking section was combined with Dagenham, and has been within a single London borough since the Ilford section was transferred to Barking and Dagenham in 1994.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat is the fourth most populous urban area in the Republic of Ireland and has the housing estate Corrib Park?\n"

Johnston (born 4 May 1943) is a prominent Irish-born psychologist whose work emphasis is emotion, and event related potentials.\n His areas of study include cognitive engineering, biopsychology, and cognitive psychology.\n His major research interests are evolutionary psychology, electrophysiology and genetic algorithms.\n Dr. Johnston states, \"The human brain did not evolve to accurately represent the world around us; it evolved only to enhance the survival of our genes.\"\n According to Johnston, the combination of emotions with symbolic thought produces meaning.\n But with this capacity comes the ability to develop meanings for things that do not exist.\n Little girls develop the ability to attach emotional feelings to dolls, and pretend that their toys live.\n Little boys learn how to pretend to hunt and fight and attach emotions to them.\n We learn feelings of desire, fear, and wonder by wandering to the limits of our play.\n Imagination allows us to create technology, mathematics, and art, but with it can also come terrifying thoughts that could cause harm to us.\n We grow to learn the difference between most of our thoughts and what they represent, but most of us get fooled into believing the reality of some things that don't exist at all.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 1\n\nLittle Girls is a Canadian indie rock band formed in 2008 from Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\n The band emerged from Toronto's post-punk scene as a solo recording project of multi-instrumentalist Josh McIntyre.\n With a focus on Minimalist Electronic, Little Girls released CULTS EP (September 6, 2011) on Hand Drawn Dracula and are currently working on their second full-length record.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 2\n\nThe My Buddy doll line was a toy brand made by Hasbro in 1985 with the intention of making a doll to appeal to little boys and teach them about caring for their friends.\n This idea was both innovative and controversial for its time, as toy dolls were traditionally associated with younger girls.\n Hasbro also introduced a companion Kid Sister marketed toward girls.\n Hasbro discontinued the line before the start of the 1990s and Playskool took over production, making changes to the likeness and clothing.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 3\n\nBreeching was the occasion when a small boy was first dressed in breeches or trousers.\n From the mid-16th century until the late 19th or early 20th century, young boys in the Western world were unbreeched and wore gowns or dresses until an age that varied between two and eight.\n Various forms of relatively subtle differences usually enabled others to tell little boys from little girls, in codes that modern art historians are able to understand.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 4\n\n\"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\"\n is episode seven of the of the American science fiction television series, \"\".\n It was first broadcast October 20, 1966, and repeated, two months later, on December 22, the first episode of the series to be repeated on NBC.\n It was written by Robert Bloch and directed by James Goldstone.\n The title of the episode is taken from the fourth line of the 19th century nursery rhyme, \"What Are Little Boys Made Of?\n.\"\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 5\n\nWord play or wordplay (also: play-on-words) is a literary technique and a form of wit in which the words that are used become the main subject of the work, primarily for the purpose of intended effect or amusement.\n Examples of word play include puns, phonetic mix-ups such as spoonerisms, obscure words and meanings, clever rhetorical excursions, oddly formed sentences, double entendres, and telling character names (such as in the play \"The Importance of Being Earnest\", \"Ernest\" being a given name that sounds exactly like the adjective \"earnest\").\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 6\n\n\"What Are Little Boys Made Of?\"\n is a popular nursery rhyme dating from the early 19th century.\n It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 821.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 7\n\nAngry Little Girls is a 1998 webcomic series by Lela Lee.\n Based on \"Angry Little Asian Girl, Five Angry Episodes\", the webcomic explores gender and racial stereotypes.\n \"Angry Little Girls\" features 6-year old Korean American character Kim, who \"refuses to be pigeonholed and instead rages against society.\"\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat type of word play does \"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\" and \"What Are Little Boys Made Of?\" have in common?\n"

Bernard, his nephew, after an adult male skin and skull was collected by them and brought to the National Museum of Canada.\n There were very few specimens of this subspecies that were recovered, around three or four in total.\n A survey was conducted in March 1993 by the Department of Renewable Resources that was to catalog the wolf and caribou populations of the area.\n While a number of caribou were found and recorded, along with many other indigenous animal species, not a single wolf was found.\n The Victoria's Island population is believed to have died out in between 1918 and 1952.\n They were previously widespread in their native habitat but were annihilated by excessive hunting.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 1\n\nRhinoceros sondaicus annamiticus is an extinct subspecies of \"Rhinoceros sondaicus\", that lived in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia.\n The term Annamiticus derives from the Annamite name of the Indochinese Mountains in Indochina, part of the distribution of this species, also known as the Javanese Javan rhinoceros or simply Vietnamese rhinoceros for Vietnam.\n Only this species, the Stieng called them Pai-mhai once lived across South China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia.\n The subspecific annamiticus is derived from the Annamite Mountain Range in Southeast Asia, part of this subspecies' range.\n In 2006, a single population, estimated at fewer than 12 remaining rhinos, lived in an area of lowland forest in the Cat Tien National Park in Vietnam.\n Genetic analysis suggested this subspecies and the Indonesian Javan rhinoceros last shared a common ancestor between 300,000 and 2 million years ago.\n The last individual of this population was shot by a poacher in 2010.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 2\n\nAs of September 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists 116 extinct species, 132 possibly extinct species, 35 extinct in the wild species, 13 possibly extinct in the wild species, five extinct subspecies, one extinct in the wild subspecies, and four extinct varieties of plant.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 3\n\nPrehistoric art in Scotland is visual art created or found within the modern borders of Scotland, before the departure of the Romans from southern and central Britain in the early fifth century CE, which is usually seen as the beginning of the early historic or Medieval era.\n There is no clear definition of prehistoric art among scholars and objects that may involve creativity often lack a context that would allow them to be understood.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 4\n\nAs of September 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists 310 extinct species, 117 possibly extinct species, 14 extinct in the wild species, eight extinct subspecies, and five extinct in the wild subspecies of mollusc.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 5\n\nTrogloxenes, also called cave guests, are animal species which live close to caves or at the very entrance of the cave, but cannot live exclusively in a cave.\n This group consists of both extant animals, such as raccoons, rats, foxes and bears, opiliones (a.k.a. Daddy-Long-Legs) and extinct animals like cave bears, cave lions, cave leopards, and cave hyenas.\n Indications trusted by geologists and archaeologists combine to show that these animals lived there in the latter part, at least, of the third interglacial epoch, and on through the fourth and last glacial advance, when, although central Europe was free from an ice cap, an almost Arctic climate prevailed, with much rain.\n This is what is known as the Upper Paleolithic, when humanity in Europe was represented by the Neanderthals.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 6\n\nAs of July 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists 394 extinct species, 206 possibly extinct species, 16 extinct in the wild species, eight extinct subspecies, and five extinct in the wild subspecies of invertebrate.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 7\n\nPanthera leo spelaea or P. spelaea, commonly known as the European or Eurasian cave lion, is an extinct subspecies of lion.\n It is known from fossils and many examples of prehistoric art.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat species has an extinct subspecies that are classified as Trogloxene and are known from fossils and prehistoric art?\n"

Merriam, a Minnesota banker and politician.\n Completed by the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad in 1880, it shortened the route Milwaukee Road trains took between downtown Saint Paul and downtown Minneapolis.\n Previous trains would exit Saint Paul and follow the Mississippi River southwest until crossing at Fort Snelling where they would follow the path of today's Hiawatha Avenue (Minnesota State Highway 55) and METRO Blue Line toward the Milwaukee Road Depot.\n Originally built as an interurban route, it was eventually converted for heavy rail traffic because the Twin City Rapid Transit streetcar system had taken over the local transit market.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 1\n\nThe Mendota Bridge (full name Fort Snelling – Mendota Bridge) carries Minnesota State Highway 55 over the Minnesota River between Fort Snelling and Mendota Heights.\n It is the final bridge over the Minnesota River before the Minnesota flows into the Mississippi River at the \"Meeting of the waters\" or \"Mendota\" in the Dakota language.\n Traffic on the north end of the bridge may turn onto the Fort Road Bridge (MN 5) to cross the Mississippi River into St. Paul, Minnesota.\n The skylines of both Minneapolis and St. Paul can be seen simultaneously from the bridge.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 2\n\nMinneapolis is the largest city by population in the U.S. state of Minnesota, and the county seat of Hennepin County.\n The origin and growth of the city was spurred by the proximity of Fort Snelling, the first major United States military presence in the area, and by its location on Saint Anthony Falls, which provided power for sawmills and flour mills.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 3\n\nIrish in Saint Paul, Minnesota have played an integral part in the founding and the growth of the city.\n The first Irish to settle in Saint Paul were three soldiers from Fort Snelling who were natives of Ireland.\n They became the first settlers in the area of downtown Saint Paul.\n Helped by Archbishop John Ireland, thousands of Irish emigrated from Ireland and Eastern cities in the United States to Minnesota; the majority settled in Saint Paul.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 4\n\nPike Island, Dakota name Wita Tanka, is an island at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers in the southwestern part of Saint Paul in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minnesota, U.S..\n The island is now part of Fort Snelling State Park.\n It is a portion of the 100000 acre of land purchased from the Mdewakanton Sioux Indians by Zebulon Pike in September 1805.\n Pike's Purchase was later to become Fort Snelling, Minneapolis, and Saint Paul.\n The U.S. government wanted to build a fort to protect American interests in the fur trade in the region, and Pike negotiated the treaty.\n Pike valued the land at $200,000, but the U.S. Senate later agreed to pay only $2000.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 5\n\nFort Snelling State Park is a state park of Minnesota, USA, at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers.\n Its most notable feature is the historic Fort Snelling, which dates from 1820.\n The fort itself is operated by the Minnesota Historical Society and requires a separate entrance fee.\n The bulk of the state park preserves the bottomland forest, rivers, and backwater lakes below the river bluffs.\n The park was opened in 1962.\n Both the State Park and Historic Fort are part of the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area, a National Park Service site.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 6\n\nSaint Paul is the second largest city in the state of Minnesota in the United States, the county seat of Ramsey County, and the state capital of Minnesota.\n The origin and growth of the city was spurred by the proximity of Fort Snelling, the first major United States military presence in the area, and by its location on the Upper Mississippi River, with the northernmost natural navigable port on the mighty river.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 7\n\nFort Snelling, originally known as Fort Saint Anthony, was a military fortification located at the confluence of Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers in Hennepin County, Minnesota.\n Mississippi National River and Recreation Area, a National Park Service unit, includes historic Fort Snelling.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTION:\nFort Snelling spurred growth of Saint Paul was located in this county?\n"

Hardenberg.\n Subtitled \"The Journal of Simple 68000 Systems\", the newsletter was dedicated to the proposition that the Motorola 68000 CPU could be used to build simple fast computers.\n In 1981 this was a revolutionary idea.\n This was before 68000-based personal computers like the Apple Macintosh, Commodore Amiga, and Atari ST had been created.\n In 1981 Motorola was marketing the 68000 solely as a CPU for high-end Unix workstations.\n Hal believed that the 68000 could be used as a simple embedded microprocessor as well, and used the newsletter to explain how to do that.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 5\n\nThe ATASCII character set, from ATARI Standard Code for Information Interchange\", alternatively ATARI ASCII\", is the variation on ASCII used in the Atari 8-bit family of home computers.\n The first of this family were the Atari 400 and 800, released in 1979, and later models were released throughout the 1980s.\n The last computer to use the ATASCII character set was the Atari XEGS which was released in 1987.\n The Atari ST family of computers used the different Atari ST character set.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 6\n\nThe Atari ST is a line of home computers from Atari Corporation and the successor to the Atari 8-bit family.\n The initial ST model, the 520ST, saw limited release in April-June 1985 and was widely available in July.\n The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bitmapped color GUI, using a version of Digital Research's GEM released in February 1985.\n The 1040ST, released in 1986, is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than US$1.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 7\n\nPage 6 (subtitled \"Atari Users Magazine\", and later known as New Atari User) was an independent British publication aimed at users of Atari home computers.\n It was published between 1982 and 1998.\n The computer magazine supported both the Atari 8-bit family of computers (400/800/XL/XE) and the Atari ST range.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTION:\nAre Prológica CP-400 and Atari ST both personal computers?\n"

J. Cherryh, published by HarperCollins.\n They are set in a medieval fantasy world with a 15th-century feel and feature magic, sorcery, medieval warfare, politics and other elements common to the high fantasy subgenre.\n The first book in the series, \"Fortress in the Eye of Time\", was published in 1995 and followed by \"Fortress of Eagles\" in 1998, \"Fortress of Owls\" in 1999, \"Fortress of Dragons\" in 2000 and \"Fortress of Ice\" in 2006.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 1\n\nJane Thayer (the pen name of Catherine Woolley, August 11, 1904 – July 23, 2005) was an American writer.\n She is known best for the book \"The Puppy Who Wanted A Boy\", which became the basis of a 1980s Saturday Morning cartoon series, \"The Puppy's Further Adventures\".\n Jane Thayer wrote 86 books for children, many of which (\"The Blueberry Pie Elf\" and \"The Puppy Who Wanted a Boy for Christmas\") have become classics.\n She was so prolific that her editor suggested she publish some of her works under a pen name.\n Thus, Catherine authored picture books under the pen name of Jane Thayer, while writing books for older children and adults under her real name.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 2\n\nMorishima Chūryō (森島 中良 , 1756 – December 29, 1810) was an Edo period Japanese author of popular fiction who also wrote a number of works in the field of rangaku (Western studies).\n He wrote under many pen names, including Manzōtei, Shinra Manzō (or, conventionally, Shinra Banshō), and Tenjiku Rōjin (\"old man from India\").\n The latter constituted an allusion to the pen name Tenjiku Rōnin (\"masterless samurai from India\"), used by Hiraga Gennai, to whom Chūryō was the principal literary successor.\n Chūryō co-authored several plays with Gennai early in his career, and went on to write in almost all of the many genres of popular fiction that were collectively known as gesaku.\n He also wrote kyōka, or comic waka poetry, under the pen name Taketsue no Sugaru.\n Chūryō was the younger brother of Katsuragawa Hoshū, a shogunal physician and leading scholar of rangaku.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 3\n\nA pen name (\"nom de plume\", or \"literary double\") is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of his or her works in place of their \"real\" name.\n A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work.\n The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 4\n\nSweeping Up Glass is a 2009 novel by Oklahoma City author Carolyn Wall that takes place within a segregated community in 1938.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 5\n\nDearie is a 1927 silent drama film produced and distributed by Warner Bros. and directed by Archie Mayo.\n It is from a story by Victorian author Carolyn Wells about a woman who sacrifices for her ungrateful son.\n This film starred Irene Rich and is considered a lost film.\n It is unknown, but the film might have been released with a Vitaphone soundtrack.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 6\n\nCarolyn Janice Cherry (born September 1, 1942), better known by the pen name C. J. Cherryh, is an American writer of speculative fiction.\n She has written more than 60 books since the mid-1970s, including the Hugo Award-winning novels \"Downbelow Station\" (1981) and \"Cyteen\" (1988), both set in her Alliance-Union universe.\n She is known for \"world building,\" depicting fictional realms with great realism supported by vast research in history, language, psychology, and archeology.\n Her series of fantasy novels set in the Alliance-Union universe, the Morgaine Stories, have sold in excess of 3 million copies.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 7\n\nRamsey Dukes is the current and most well-known pen name of Lionel Snell, a contemporary English magician, publisher and author on magic and philosophy.\n He has also under the pen names Lemuel Johnston.\n Angerford and Lea, Adamai Philotunus and Per Anum Ad Astra.\n His regular satirical column \"The Satanist's Diary\" was published in the magazine \"Aquarian Arrow\" during the 1980s and early 1990s under the pen name The Hon Hugo C StJ l'Estrange and included a multitude of other pen names as contributors.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat is the pen name of author Carolyn Janice Cherry, who wrote the Fortress Series?\n"

lager-style beer brewed by Lion Breweries, part of the Lion Nathan group.\n The beer is 4.0% alcohol.\n Because of its relatively low alcohol content it is widely regarded as an excellent 'session' beer, that is, a beer that can be consumed freely over a long session of time without all the adverse effects of a higher alcohol volume beer.\n As such, it is also a favourite of university students, along with similar strength beers such as Speights and DB Draught.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 1\n\nHerkenrode Tripel is a Belgian Abbey beer brewed for the Herkenrode Foundation by commercial brewery St. Joseph in Opitter (Bree, Flanders in Belgium).\n It is on the market since July 2009.\n It has an alcohol by volume percentage of 7%.\n In June 2009 the Federation of Belgian Brewers awarded the beer the name and the logo of Recognized Belgian Abbey Beer.\n In the Herkenrode Abbey in Hasselt, which was founded in 1182, beer was brewed until the French Revolution in the brewery of the abbey.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 2\n\nLambic is a type of beer brewed in the Pajottenland region of Belgium southwest of Brussels and in Brussels itself at the Cantillon Brewery.\n Lambic beers include gueuze and kriek lambic.\n Lambic differs from most other beers in that it is fermented through exposure to wild yeasts and bacteria native to the Zenne valley, as opposed to exposure to carefully cultivated strains of brewer's yeast.\n This process gives the beer its distinctive flavour: dry, vinous, and cidery, usually with a sour aftertaste.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 3\n\nWild Goose is a brand of beer brewed by the Logan Shaw Brewing Company of Washington, D.C..\n The brand is available in traditional English style ale including India Pale Ale and an Oatmeal Stout.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 4\n\nAmerican wild ale generally refers to beers brewed in America using yeast or bacteria in addition to \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" for fermentation.\n Such beers may be similar to traditional beers such as Lambic and Oud bruin, and are typically fermented using a strain of \"brettanomyces\" for part or all of the fermentation.\n The use of brettanomyces can result in a \"funky\" flavor profile.\n Examples include Jolly Pumpkin Perseguidor, Avery 15 and Brabant, Ommegang Ommegeddon.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 5\n\nKentucky Common Beer is a once-popular style of ale from the area in and around Louisville, Kentucky from the 1850s until Prohibition.\n This style is rarely brewed commercially today.\n It was also locally known as \"Dark Cream Common Beer\", \"Cream Beer\" or \"Common Beer\".\n The beer was top-fermented and wasn't krausened, i.e., it was fermented once and sent out for sale which meant the gravity would be moderate, the carbonation low and the taste full and sweetish.\n Like cream ale, it was consumed fresh, usually as draught beer.\n In 1913 it was estimated that 80% of the beer consumed in Louisville was of this type.\n Many local breweries made this style of beer exclusively.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 6\n\nHeavy Seas Beer is brewed by Clipper City Brewing Company, in Baltimore, Maryland.\n The brewery was established by Hugh Sisson in 1995.\n Previously, Sisson operated Maryland's first brewpub, Sisson's.\n In 2010, the brewery rebranded.\n While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand.\n Heavy Seas hosts tours on most weekends.\n It is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore.\n Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\n Several Heavy Seas beers have been awarded and include the following: Cutlass Amber Lager (a repeat medal winner at the Great American Beer Festival from 2006-2010, bronze medal winner at the 2010 World Beer Cup and silver medal winner at the 2012 World Beer Cup as Heavy Seas Märzen), Powder Monkey Pale Ale (silver medal winner at the 2008 Great American Beer Festival and bronze medal winner at the 2010 World Beer Cup as Heavy Seas Pale Ale), Small Craft Warning Uber Pils (bronze medal winner at the 2004 Great American Beer Festival), Gold Ale (gold medal winner at the 2010 World Beer Cup, bronze medal winner at the 2010 Great American Beer Festival and bronze medal winner at the 2014 Great American Beer Festival as Heavy Seas Gold Ale) and Winter Storm Imperial ESB (gold medal winner at the 2008 World Beer Cup).\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 7\n\nRogue Ales Beard Beer is an American wild ale brewed by Rogue Ales of Newport, Oregon using wild yeast originally cultured from nine beard hairs belonging to Rogue Ales' brewmaster, John Maier.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTION:\nWhich f beer brewed in the Pajottenland region  American wild ale similar to\n"

Bennett (fl.\n 1830s, died October 20, 1848) was an early settler of Montgomery County, Texas who served as lieutenant colonel in the Battle of San Jacinto and the Somervell Expedition.\n He later served in the Texas House of Representatives from 1838-1840.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 1\n\nLieutenant colonel is a rank of commissioned officer in the armies and most marine forces and some air forces of the world, above a major and below a colonel.\n The rank of lieutenant colonel is often shortened to simply \"colonel\" in conversation and in unofficial correspondence.\n Sometimes, the term, 'half-colonel' is used in casual conversation in the British Army.\n A lieutenant colonel is typically in charge of a battalion in the army.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 2\n\nThe Battle of San Jacinto, fought on April 21, 1836, in present-day Harris County, Texas, was the decisive battle of the Texas Revolution.\n Led by General Sam Houston, the Texian Army engaged and defeated General Antonio López de Santa Anna's Mexican army in a fight that lasted just 18 minutes.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 3\n\nThe Grass Fight was a small battle during the Texas Revolution, fought between the Mexican Army and the Texian Army.\n The battle took place on November 26, 1835, just south of San Antonio de Béxar in the Mexican region of Texas.\n The Texas Revolution had officially begun on October 2 and by the end of the month the Texian had initiated a siege of Béxar, home of the largest Mexican garrison in the province.\n Bored with the inactivity, many of the Texian soldiers returned home; a smaller number of adventurers from the United States arrived to replace them.\n After the Texian Army rejected commander-in-chief Stephen F. Austin's call to launch an assault on Béxar on November 22, Austin resigned from the army.\n The men elected Edward Burleson their new commander-in-chief.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 4\n\nThe Battle of Coleto, also known as the Battle of Coleto Creek, the Battle of the Prairie, and the Batalla del encinal del Perdido, was fought on March 19–20, 1836, during the Goliad campaign of the Texas Revolution.\n In February, General José de Urrea led a branch of the Mexican army up the Gulf Coast of Mexican Texas toward Goliad, where a large contingent of soldiers from the Texian Army were garrisoned under Colonel James W. Fannin.\n Simultaneously, Mexican president Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna led a larger force into the Texian interior, where on March 6 his troops won the Battle of the Alamo.\n After learning of the Alamo's defeat, Texian general Sam Houston ordered Fannin to retreat from Goliad and join the rest of the army in Victoria.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 5\n\nThe Siege of Béxar (or Bejar) was an early campaign of the Texas Revolution in which a volunteer Texian army defeated Mexican forces at San Antonio de Béxar (now San Antonio, Texas, US).\n Texians had become disillusioned with the Mexican government as President and General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna's tenure became increasingly dictatorial.\n In early October, 1835, Texas settlers gathered in Gonzales to stop Mexican troops from reclaiming a small cannon.\n The resulting skirmish, known as the Battle of Gonzales, launched the Texas Revolution.\n Men continued to assemble in Gonzales and soon established the Texian Army.\n Despite a lack of military training, well-respected local leader General Stephen F. Austin was elected commander.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 6\n\nThe Battle of Bennington was a battle of the American Revolutionary War, part of the Saratoga campaign, that took place on August 16, 1777, in Walloomsac, New York, about 10 mi from its namesake Bennington, Vermont.\n A rebel force of 2,000 men, primarily composed of New Hampshire and Massachusetts militiamen, led by General John Stark, and reinforced by Vermont militiamen led by Colonel Seth Warner and members of the Green Mountain Boys, decisively defeated a detachment of General John Burgoyne's army led by Lieutenant Colonel Friedrich Baum, and supported by additional men under Lieutenant Colonel Heinrich von Breymann.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 7\n\nLieutenant Colonel Qazi Altaf Hussain (1920–1999) served in the British Indian Army later taking up a place in the Army of Pakistan.\n He advanced to various positions of leadership during his military career, serving as lieutenant colonel of the 11 Frontier Force Regiment, commandant of the Zhob Militia in Quetta, Pakistan, and commander of a regiment in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.\n He was forced to retire as a lieutenant colonel, instead of advancing to general, as a result of his short-tempered, frank and outspoken nature.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTION:\nWho led the Texian Army in the battle in whichJoseph L.
