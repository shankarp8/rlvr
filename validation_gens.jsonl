2009.\n His district includes portions of Indian River, Martin, Okeechobee, Palm Beach and St. Lucie Counties.\n He was previously a member of the Florida House of Representatives from 1990 through 2000.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 3\n\nThe Senate is Burkina Faso's uncreated legislative upper chamber under the amended Constitution of Burkina Faso.\n The original upper house (Chamber of Representatives) was abolished in 2002, making the legislature unicameral.\n The upper house was to have been restored under the name \"Senate\" in the June 2012 constitutional amendments.\n This revision was never executed due to an extended and unresolved political confrontation over the Senate's establishment, which left the country effectively with a unicameral legislature as of the October 2014 constitutional crisis.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 4\n\nThe New South Wales Legislative Council, or upper house, is one of the two chambers of the parliament of the Australian state of New South Wales.\n The other is the Legislative Assembly.\n Both sit at Parliament House in the state capital, Sydney.\n The Assembly is referred to as the lower house and the Council as the upper house.\n It is normal for legislation to be first deliberated on and enacted in the lower house, and then considered in the upper house, which acts in the main as a house of review.\n The Council has 42 members, elected by proportional representation in which the whole state is treated as a single electorate.\n Members serve eight-year terms, which are staggered so that half the Council is up for election every four years—roughly coinciding with elections to the Legislative Assembly.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 5\n\nAn upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house.\n The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and often has more restricted power, than the lower house.\n Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 6\n\nThe Alaska Legislature is the state

Bernard, his nephew, after an adult male skin and skull was collected by them and brought to the National Museum of Canada.\n There were very few specimens of this subspecies that were recovered, around three or four in total.\n A survey was conducted in March 1993 by the Department of Renewable Resources that was to catalog the wolf and caribou populations of the area.\n While a number of caribou were found and recorded, along with many other indigenous animal species, not a single wolf was found.\n The Victoria's Island population is believed to have died out in between 1918 and 1952.\n They were previously widespread in their native habitat but were annihilated by excessive hunting.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 1\n\nRhinoceros sondaicus annamiticus is an extinct subspecies of \"Rhinoceros sondaicus\", that lived in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia.\n The term Annamiticus derives from the Annamite name of the Indochinese Mountains in Indochina, part of the distribution of this species, also known as the Javanese Javan rhinoceros or simply Vietnamese rhinoceros for Vietnam.\n Only this species, the Stieng called them Pai-mhai once lived across South China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia.\n The subspecific annamiticus is derived from the Annamite Mountain Range in Southeast Asia, part of this subspecies' range.\n In 2006, a single population, estimated at fewer than 12 remaining rhinos, lived in an area of lowland forest in the Cat Tien National Park in Vietnam.\n Genetic analysis suggested this subspecies and the Indonesian Javan rhinoceros last shared a common ancestor between 300,000 and 2 million years ago.\n The last individual of this population was shot by a poacher in 2010.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 2\n\nAs of September 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists 116 extinct species, 132 possibly extinct species, 35 extinct in the wild species, 13 possibly extinct in the wild species, five extinct subspecies, one extinct in the wild subspecies, and four extinct varieties of plant.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 3\n\nPrehistoric art in Scotland is visual art created or found within the modern borders of Scotland, before the departure of the Romans from southern and central Britain in the early fifth century CE, which is usually seen as the beginning of the early historic or Medieval era.\n There is no clear definition of prehistoric art among scholars and objects that may involve creativity often lack a context that would allow them to be understood.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 4\n\nAs of September 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists 310 extinct species, 117 possibly extinct species, 14 extinct in the wild species, eight extinct subspecies, and five extinct in the wild subspecies of mollusc.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 5\n\nTrogloxenes, also called cave guests, are animal species which live close to caves or at the very entrance of the cave, but cannot live exclusively in a cave.\n This group consists of both extant animals, such as raccoons, rats, foxes and bears, opiliones (a.k.a. Daddy-Long-Legs) and extinct animals like cave bears, cave lions, cave leopards, and cave hyenas.\n Indications trusted by geologists and archaeologists combine to show that these animals lived there in the latter part, at least, of the third interglacial epoch, and on through the fourth and last glacial advance, when, although central Europe was free from an ice cap, an almost Arctic climate prevailed, with much rain.\n This is what is known as the Upper Paleolithic, when humanity in Europe was represented by the Neanderthals.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 6\n\nAs of July 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists 394 extinct species, 206 possibly extinct species, 16 extinct in the wild species, eight extinct subspecies, and five extinct in the wild subspecies of invertebrate.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 7\n\nPanthera leo spelaea or P. spelaea, commonly known as the European or Eurasian cave lion, is an extinct subspecies of lion.\n It is known from fossils and many examples of prehistoric art.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat species has an extinct subspecies that are classified as Trogloxene and are known from fossils and prehistoric art?\n", "generation": "<confidence> 0.05 </confidence><think> The question specifies a species with an extinct subspecies that qualifies as Trogloxene and is documented by fossils and prehistoric art.

Of all the provided contexts, the European cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea, commonly known as the European or Eurasian cave lion) fits best. This is because it is described as an extinct subspecies of lion that is fairly well-documented by fossils and prehistoric art. The extant species mentioned only belong to other taxonomic categories (invertebrates, mollusks, prehistoric art, etc.), or have different criteria defined in the context.

Merriam, a Minnesota banker and politician.\n Completed by the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad in 1880, it shortened the route Milwaukee Road trains took between downtown Saint Paul and downtown Minneapolis.\n Previous trains would exit Saint Paul and follow the Mississippi River southwest until crossing at Fort Snelling where they would follow the path of today's Hiawatha Avenue (Minnesota State Highway 55) and METRO Blue Line toward the Milwaukee Road Depot.\n Originally built as an interurban route, it was eventually converted for heavy rail traffic because the Twin City Rapid Transit streetcar system had taken over the local transit market.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 1\n\nThe Mendota Bridge (full name Fort Snelling – Mendota Bridge) carries Minnesota State Highway 55 over the Minnesota River between Fort Snelling and Mendota Heights.\n It is the final bridge over the Minnesota River before the Minnesota flows into the Mississippi River at the \"Meeting of the waters\" or \"Mendota\" in the Dakota language.\n Traffic on the north end of the bridge may turn onto the Fort Road Bridge (MN 5) to cross the Mississippi River into St. Paul, Minnesota.\n The skylines of both Minneapolis and St. Paul can be seen simultaneously from the bridge.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 2\n\nMinneapolis is the largest city by population in the U.S. state of Minnesota, and the county seat of Hennepin County.\n The origin and growth of the city was spurred by the proximity of Fort Snelling, the first major United States military presence in the area, and by its location on Saint Anthony Falls, which provided power for sawmills and flour mills.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 3\n\nIrish in Saint Paul, Minnesota have played an integral part in the founding and the growth of the city.\n The first Irish to settle in Saint Paul were three soldiers from Fort Snelling who were natives of Ireland.\n They became the first settlers in the area of downtown Saint Paul.\n Helped by Archbishop John Ireland, thousands of Irish emigrated from Ireland and Eastern cities in the United States to Minnesota; the majority settled in Saint Paul.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 4\n\nPike Island, Dakota name Wita Tanka, is an island at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers in the southwestern part of Saint Paul in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minnesota, U.S..\n The island is now part of Fort Snelling State Park.\n It is a portion of the 100000 acre of land purchased from the Mdewakanton Sioux Indians by Zebulon Pike in September 1805.\n Pike's Purchase was later to become Fort Snelling, Minneapolis, and Saint Paul.\n The U.S. government wanted to build a fort to protect American interests in the fur trade in the region, and Pike negotiated the treaty.\n Pike valued the land at $200,000, but the U.S. Senate later agreed to pay only $2000.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 5\n\nFort Snelling State Park is a state park of Minnesota, USA, at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers.\n Its most notable feature is the historic Fort Snelling, which dates from 1820.\n The fort itself is operated by the Minnesota Historical Society and requires a separate entrance fee.\n The bulk of the state park preserves the bottomland forest, rivers, and backwater lakes below the river bluffs.\n The park was opened in 1962.\n Both the State Park and Historic Fort are part of the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area, a National Park Service site.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 6\n\nSaint Paul is the second largest city in the state of Minnesota in the United States, the county seat of Ramsey County, and the state capital of Minnesota.\n The origin and growth of the city was spurred by the proximity of Fort Snelling, the first major United States military presence in the area, and by its location on the Upper Mississippi River, with the northernmost natural navigable port on the mighty river.\n\n--------------------------------\nParagraph 7\n\nFort Snelling, originally known as Fort Saint Anthony, was a military fortification located at the confluence of Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers in Hennepin County, Minnesota.\n Mississippi National River and Recreation Area, a National Park Service unit, includes historic Fort Snelling.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTION:\nFort Snelling spurred growth of Saint Paul was located in this county?\n", "generation": "<confidence> 0.05 </confidence><think> The question asks specifically about the county in which Fort Snelling was located.

From the context, we learn that Steve Rash is known as a film director and has directed various films that fall into or might encompass the description of a 'teens comedy about a high school nerd, which include 'Can't Buy Me Love', and 'Bring It On: All or Nothing'. 'Can't Buy Me Love' is explicitly described as a 'teens romantic comedy film'. Thus, the male lead from 'Can't Buy Me Love' is likely the answer. Meanwhile, Ryan Reynolds is mentioned in the 'Just Friends' paragraph but not described as in the mentioned films. Both Robin Williams and Paul Rudd are mentioned in the 'Night Before' context as starring actors for that film, but the exact film was 'Night Before' and not the ones mentioned in Steve Rash's directed films. Therefore the answer can be reasonably believed to be Patrick Dempsey.</think><answer> Patrick Dempsey </answer>"}
